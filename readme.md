# Design Patterns # 

Divided into 3 categories based on objectives

1. Creational Patterns - object creation

2. Structural Patterns - object assembly

3. Behavioral Patterns - object creation



## Creational Patterns ##


### Singelton ###
When a single instance of a class is needed.

Logger, Database 
<br/>
<br/>

### Factory Method ###
Decouple object creation from usage.

Create different types of database connections based on configuration
<br/>
<br/>

### Abstract Factory ###
Create families of related objects.

Build parsers for different file formats (e.g. JSON, XML, CSV). <br/><br/>


### Builder ###
Constructing complex objects step by step.<br/><br/>


### Prototype ###
A partially or fully initialized object that you copy(clone) and make use of. </br>
Creating duplicate objects and reusing cached objects to reduce database calls. </br>
Requires deep copy support.</br></br>
