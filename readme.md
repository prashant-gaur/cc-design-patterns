# Design Patterns # 

Divided into 3 categories based on objectives

    1. Creational Patterns - Creation of objects

    2. Structural Patterns - Assembly of objects

    3. Behavioral Patterns - Interactions between objects



## Creational Patterns ##


### Singelton ###
    When a single instance of a class is needed.

    For example - Logger, Database


### Factory Method ###
    Decouple object creation from usage.

    For example - Create different types of database connections based on configuration


### Abstract Factory ###
    Create families of related objects.

    For example - Build parsers for different file formats (e.g. JSON, XML, CSV).


### Builder ###
    Constructing complex objects step by step.


### Prototype ###
    A partially or fully initialized object that you copy(clone) and make use of.

    For example - Creating duplicate objects and reusing cached objects to reduce database calls.
    Requires deep copy support.
